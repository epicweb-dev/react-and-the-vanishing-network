# React and the Vanishing Network 🧙

👨‍💼 Welcome to our workshop on React and the Vanishing Network! I'm Peter the
Product Manager, and I'll be guiding you through the fascinating evolution of
web application architecture and network management in React applications.

In this workshop, you'll explore the historical progression of how we've handled
network interactions in web apps, ultimately leading to modern solutions that
simplify network management. We'll journey through:

1. Multi-Page Applications (MPA)
2. Single-Page Applications (SPA)
3. Progressive Enhancement SPA (PESPA)
4. React Server Components (RSC)

As we progress through each architecture, you'll:

- Understand the challenges each approach aimed to solve
- Implement network management techniques specific to each era
- Observe how the code for managing network interactions has evolved
- Discover how React Server Components eliminate the need for custom network
  management code

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of:

- The historical context of web application architectures
- How network management strategies have changed over time
- The benefits and trade-offs of each approach
- Why React Server Components represent a significant leap forward in
  simplifying network handling

Let's embark on this journey through time and see how React has helped us
make network problems vanish! 🪄🕰️

	Note in this workshop we're not using any libraries or frameworks other than
	packages from React and some custom code. For example, when we do the
	frameworks bit, we have a very simple example of a framework that resemble's
	Remix's `loader` and `action` concept. And when we do the React Server
	Components bit, we have a very simple version based on the "React Flight ESM"
	demo from the React repository.
