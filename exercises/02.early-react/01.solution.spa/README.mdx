# SPA

👨‍💼 Great work. We should be able to ship much faster and fewer bugs now that we
don't have to duplicate UI logic between the server render and the client-side
code.

However, let's take a moment to look into the network management... Because it's
not great.

First, we've completely abandoned progressive enhancement. It's mostly fine
because all our users have JavaScript enabled, but now JavaScript enables our
experience rather than enhancing it which means we have to have a loading screen
while the user waits for our JavaScript to load (before they could submit the
form as soon as the HTML loaded).

Secondly, we have a TON of code for managing the network request. What used to
be handled nicely by the browser is now handled by our React code.

If only there was a better way to manage network requests...
