# SPA (Single Page Application)

👨‍💼 Hello again! We've got an exciting project ahead of us. Our users want us to
deliver features and bug fixes faster with fewer bugs and we've decided the
duplication of UI logic between the server render and the client-side code is
slowing us down

To speed things up and make our users happier, we're going to convert our
existing Multi-Page Application into a Single Page Application using React.

🧝‍♂️ Hi, I'm Kellie. I've already done a number of things to get things set up for
our React app. You can <PrevDiffLink>check the diff</PrevDiffLink> to see what
I've done so far.

👨‍💼Thanks Kellie!

Ok, so your main remaining tasks are to:

1. Create initial state with `count`, `loading`, and `error`
2. Implement `counterReducer` for various action types
3. Use `useReducer` and `useEffect` hooks
4. Implement `fetchCount` and `updateCount` functions
5. Handle `loading` and `error` states in the UI

Good luck, and let's create something amazing! 🚀
