# Modern React

Remix is a terrific framework, but it has one big downside. It's mixing
compositional paradigms. You have nested routes and nested components.

In Remix, we get a lot of benefit out of splitting data management from the UI.
However, we are stuck with the nested route boundaries as the place where this
happens.

To work around this, we have the
[Full Stack Components](https://www.epicweb.dev/full-stack-components) pattern.
This pattern takes advantage of Remix's resource route feature which simply
allows us to get an API endpoint at a route provided it does not have a
`default` export. So instead we export a component with a name and then that
component is wired up to the route where it appears:

For a full example, check the blog post linked above, but here are the relevant
bits from it:

```tsx lines=24
import { json, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useFetcher } from '@remix-run/react'
import { searchCustomers } from '#app/models/customer.server.ts'
import { requireUser } from '#app/session.server.ts'

export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	await requireUser(request)
	const url = new URL(request.url)
	const query = url.searchParams.get('query')
	invariant(typeof query === 'string', 'query is required')
	return json({
		customers: await searchCustomers(query),
	})
}

export function CustomerCombobox({ error }: { error?: string | null }) {
	const customerFetcher = useFetcher<typeof loader>()
	// ... other state and setup ...

	// Example of how the loader is called in the UI
	const handleInputChange = (changes) => {
		customerFetcher.submit(
			{ query: changes.inputValue ?? '' },
			{ method: 'get', action: '/resources/customers' },
		)
	}

	// ... rest of the component implementation ...
}
```

One problem here is we have to manually wire up the fetcher to the loader.
Another issue with this pattern which is not depicted here is if we wanted to
preload any of this data, we would have to add it as a prop to the component
and then anywhere it's rendered, find the nearest parent route and add the data
to that route's loader.

We can do better. With the right framework primitives, we can completely
eliminate the network from our code.

## React Server Components and Actions

React has always been the best composition paradigm. Rather than routes being
the composition boundary, we can use React Server Components to compose our
application.

Server components can manage loading our data and server actions can manage
mutating it.

Using RSCs and server actions, we can compose these different pieces together
at any level and everything simply becomes a React component.
