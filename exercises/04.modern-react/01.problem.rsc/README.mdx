# RSC

👨‍💼 Now we have a framework built with React Server Components!

🧝‍♂️ <PrevDiffLink>You're welcome</PrevDiffLink> 😉

👨‍💼 Yes, thank you Kellie!

Now you just need to implement the `Counter` component using RSCs and server
actions!

This will involve adding a `'use server'` directive
to <InlineFile file="./ui/counter.js" /> so the action can be referenced in the
client. And then adding a `'use client'` directive
to <InlineFile file="./ui/pending-form.js" /> so that code goes to the client
and can be used to show pending state while the action is being processed.

From there, <InlineFile file="./ui/counter.js" /> runs fully on the server so
you can do whatever you need to do server-side to make it work.

🦉 Take special note of your network code and where the boundaries are between
server and client.
