# Modern React

👨‍💼 Awesome work!

🦉 It's important to note that there are some bumps in the road when upgrading
your knowledge and familiarity with React Server Components and Actions. It's a
new way to build React applications and the boundaries between server and client
are different than what you might be used to.

The network is really something we can never get away from in reality, but with
a good understanding of how to compose server components, client components, and
server actions, you can build really powerful applications.
