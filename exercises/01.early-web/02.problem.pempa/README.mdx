👨‍💼 Our users aren't all that happy about the full page reloads. They want a
better experience, so let's add some client-side JavaScript to make the
experience a bit smoother.

Additionally, users want to have some pending UI that's better than the
browser's default "favicon" spinner. So you'll need to manage that as well.

You'll need to:

1. Add a script tag to the page to load the JavaScript
2. Add the JavaScript to handle the form submission, count update and pending UI
3. Update the server to handle the JavaScript submitted form

Don't worry about the error for now. Just log it to the console.

Also, keep in mind that this is a progressive enhancement so we need to make
sure that the server still works even if the JavaScript isn't loaded.

You got this!
