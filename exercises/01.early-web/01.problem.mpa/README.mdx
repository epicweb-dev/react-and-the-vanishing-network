👨‍💼 Our users want to count things. In this exercise, we already have the
scaffolding for a simple hono.js application. Your job is to implement the
following:

1. Render the current count on the page
2. Implement the form to update the count
3. Implement the logic to update the count
4. Redirect to the home page

Good luck!
