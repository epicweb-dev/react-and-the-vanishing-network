üë®‚Äçüíº Great job! The user experience is much better now!

Let's talk about the network related code we had to implement ourselves. Keep in
mind that this is still technically an MPA, just with progressive enhancement.
So we have the same characteristics as before, except we've now added a whole
bunch of extra code for making and managing the network request both on the
server and in the browser.

Additionally, we now have two places where we're updating the UI: the server
code and the client code. For our simple app this isn't a big deal, but in a
real application this is a maintenance nightmare.

This maintenance nightmare is what drove the evolution towards frameworks
like React that manage the UI in a single place.
