👨‍💼 Let's turn our application into a **Progressively Enhanced Single Page
Application** by using a framework.

🧝‍♂️ I've already built out the framework for you. Your job is to simply implement
the `loader`, `action`, and the UI for our counter component. If you want to see
what I changed, check <PrevDiffLink>the diff</PrevDiffLink>.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie!

So now, please handle the bits of the application that product developers need
to worry about now that we have a framework and pay special attention to how
much network related code you have to write. Especially imagine how this would
scale to a large application with routing.
