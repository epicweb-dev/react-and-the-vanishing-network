# Framework React

As a result of the network management issues, libraries and frameworks were
created to help manage network requests. React Query became the most popular
library for this.

In the early days of React Frameworks, the emphasis was on loading data
(arguably the easier part of network management) and then Remix was created
which is a full stack framework built on top of React Router and inspired by
standard web platform APIs. It introduced not only great loading state
management but also great routing and form management.

The core concept of Framework React is that the framework takes care of the
network requests and you the developer simply provide the code for the UI, data
loading, and form actions.

It's not perfect, but as you'll see in this exercise, there's much less code you
have to write that relates to network management.

	One of the benefits of this approach as well is it allows us to bring back
	progressive enhancement while still maintaining the qualities our users (and
	developers) have come to appreciate about SPAs. Which is why this architecture
	is referred to as a **"Progressively Enhanced Single Page Application"**.
