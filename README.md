  <strong>
    A step-by-step walk through the history of web app architecture
  </strong>
  <p>
    We go through Multi-Page Apps (MPA), to Progressively Enhanced Multi-Page Apps (PEMPA), to Single Page Apps (SPA), and then to Progressively Enhanced Single Page Apps (PESPA). In the process, we can watch how the code we have to write involving the network expands and then disappears thanks to React Server Components and Actions.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of web development

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- The Web's Next Transition:
  [article](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-webs-next-transition),
  [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXR-994OkCM&list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgNqzNwcs4UKrlJdhfDjshf),
  and [slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/the-webs-next-transition)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v18 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

> **Warning**: This repo is _very_ large. Make sure you have a good internet
> connection before you start the setup process. The instructions below use
> `--depth` to limit the amount you download, but if you have a slow connection,
> or you pay for bandwidth, you may want to find a place with a better
> connection.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/react-and-the-vanishing-network.git
cd react-and-the-vanishing-network
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.
